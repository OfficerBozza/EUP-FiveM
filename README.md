# EUP-FiveM
Official Public EUP Release for FiveM

This repository contains all of the clothing assets in the two main EUP Packs in a FiveM-ready format.
This repository does not contain any menus of any kind. It is up to you to find a way to select these in your server.

## DLC compatibility with FiveM and EUP 8.2+

Since EUP is a singleplayer mod, it utilises the content from the latest game updates and DLCs. FiveM, on the other hand, is about two whole years behind GTA V and GTA:O in terms of updates and DLC. As such, some clothing that is available in the base game is not accessible by default in FiveM. (Please keep in mind that EUP works by replacing clothes in the base game and its DLCs.) 

In order to get around this, you will need to enforce usage of the latest game build by clients who connect to your server. This can be done by adding the following launch argument: `+set sv_enforceGameBuild 2189` (This will ensure the clients connecting to your server will be using the lastest 'Cayo Perico Heist Update', which has some clothes that EUP replaces, such as hats, turnout gear, etc.)

## What's with all this stuff I hear about Patreon, license keys and Element Club?

For servers with over 8 player slots, you are required to be pledged to __[FiveM's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/fivem)__ with Element Club Argentum or higher in order to be able to stream any custom clothing mods for MP characters and other similar player characters. (EUP is one such mod.)

Note: FiveM Patreon mentioned above is an entirely seperate entity from EUP and the EUP Patreon, which will be discussed further down.

You need to have a Patreon Account and a FiveM forums account. Both of these accounts need to be registered under the same e-mail address. Once you've pledged, create a FiveM license key [here](https://keymaster.fivem.net/) if you haven't already, and add it to your server.cfg.

Note for ZAP-Hosting servers: this key is added in the 'Custom license key (optional)' box in your server panel.

Within a few hours, your server will be given the benefits listed on the Patreon tier that you pledged to. Remember to restart your server for these changes to take effect.

## What's an EUP Key? Why do you charge to use EUP in FiveM?

We do not charge anyone to be able to use EUP in FiveM. That is entirely a decision made by FiveM's developers, and we do not support it. Unfortunately, there's not much we can do about it, either.

Also, EUP keys aren't a thing. They're FiveM license keys, and we don't have anything to do with them either.
